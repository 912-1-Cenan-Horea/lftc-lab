The program reads data from the file
File structure (BNF)

<symbol> | <symbol>, <set-of-symbols> // the alphabet of the language
<state> // the initial state
<state> | <state>, <set-of-states> // the set of states
<state> | <state>, <set-of-states> // the set of states that are final
<startState> <endState> <symbol> // the transition function


After it reads the data from the file, the code is able to validate a given word by starting from the initial state
and trying to find a transition containing the required symbol. It will continue with the current_state as initial state.
if it encounters a non-valid symbol (there is no transition from current state to another, passing through the required symbol),
will return false, otherwise will continue until it reaches a final state. If it reaches a final state, will return true, otherwise false.
